# OpenAlice Implementation Plans

This file indexes substantial, multi-step implementation work. Plans describe
how repository truth will change; owner guides under [[docs/README.md]] describe
the durable truth after it changes.

## Plan Contract

- Create `plans/<topic>.md` when work spans multiple subsystems, delivery
  increments, or sessions.
- Each plan names its status, related issues, owner guides, scope, decisions,
  ordered checklist, verification, and completion criteria.
- Update progress in the same commit as the work it describes. Do not mark a
  step complete before its code and required verification exist.
- Record material discoveries and changed decisions in the plan. Move stable
  architectural conclusions into the linked owner guide.
- Keep completed plans in the repository as concise execution history and move
  their index entry from Active to Completed.
- Use GitHub issues for externally visible defects and deferred findings; plans
  may coordinate those issues but do not replace them.

## Active

- [[plans/broker-pack-release-safety.md]] — Repairing the v0.85 existing-user
  Broker Pack upgrade gap and making N-1→N reconciliation a blocking v0.86
  release contract.

## Completed

- [[plans/workspace-launch-configuration.md]] — Made the next Workspace runtime
  launch plan inspectable from the existing Workspace settings panel.
- [[plans/windows-headless-launch.md]] — Safely launches Windows npm Agent
  runtimes for scheduled work and makes pre-process failures observable.
- [[plans/issue-model-effort-overrides.md]] — Separated login-backed Workspace
  model defaults from provider isolation and added per-run Issue model/effort
  overrides. Delivered in PR #715; closed GitHub issues #706 and #710.
